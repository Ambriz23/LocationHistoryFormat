# Contributing

Open collaboration is fundamental for this project, as a single person can't cover all edge cases and nuances of the files.
Moreover, the format is constantly changing, so updates will frequently be needed.

Changes to the exported data is usually not rolled out at the same time for all Google users, and additionally, Google doesn't provide any versioning system or version clues for these files.

Both of these facts makes formalizing and keeping track of changes a difficult and unique challenge.

Due to the sensible information, proof is not required, and it would be useless anyway. So good faith and 'rigurosity' is expected from contributors.

Contributing to the schema definition:

Always must have an 'added' or 'removed' if it applies.

The documentation reference is generated automatically from the schemas, do not attempt to make markdown changes for the referneces pages, instead modify the JSON schema.

`description` fields can use markdown syntax (keep to a minimum, only italics, links and inline code to reference other fields or cite examples is recommended)

`title` field is required (usually just humanify the key)

Compiling:
Run xxx. Will generate .md files.
